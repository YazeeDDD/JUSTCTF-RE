# JUSTCTF-RE
Write-ups for the challenges that I've managed to solve from the late JUST_CTF competition.
NOTE:
I did come close with my teammate Malik to solve the terminator challenge, but due to a mistake in copying the code we reached the right solution but on a wrong input so the we never got the flag, well upload it once we have the time to go back and look at the challenge once again.
For the last Challenge, not much time was left on the clock so i couldn't even open it and find out what it actually is.
